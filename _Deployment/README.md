# _Deployment

This directory contains _Rel_ documentation and facilities for
generating _Rel_ distribution packages.

Use `buildProduct.sh` to generate _Rel_ distribution packages.

Use `clearProduct.sh` to delete previously-generated _Rel_ distribution packages.

Use `updateVersion.sh` to change to the next release version after releasing distribution packages.

Generated release packages are found in the `product` subdirectory.

Further documentation is in comments at the start of `buildProduct.sh`.
