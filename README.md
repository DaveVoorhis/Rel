This is the live development repository for Rel.

If you wish to work with the source code, it can be imported directly
into Eclipse.  First, you'll need the JavaCC Eclipse plugin.  Download
and install it from http://eclipse-javacc.sourceforge.net/

Then, in Eclipse, select "File | Import... | Git | Projects from Git"
and pick "Clone URI".  The URI is
https://github.com/DaveVoorhis/Rel.git

See the RelDeployment directory for installable versions of Rel.
These are executable Java .jar files, with names of the form
RelInstall-x.y.z.jar

Read the RelDeployment/README.txt file for further information on
running Rel.

For support or to discuss Rel, see the Rel Forum at
