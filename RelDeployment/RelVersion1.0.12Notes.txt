This version of Rel -- an implementation of Date & Darwen's "Tutorial D" 
database language -- is a maintenance release featuring some enhancements 
and bug fixes.

Changes in this update:

* Enhancement: Rel: Updated storage engine to Oracle Berkeley DB Java
Edition version 6.2.7.

* Enhancement: Rel: Database resilience after power failures or system
crashes has been considerably increased.  In the majority of power
failures or system crashes, it should be possible to load Rel and
resume use without errors or data loss.

* Fix: Rel: Updates to relation-valued parameters, which created
side-effects, have been disallowed.

* Fix: Rel: TREAT_AS_type() and IS_type() did not work correctly with
static inheritance.  This has been corrected.

* Fix: Rel: The following...
	   TYPE Temperature UNION;
	   TYPE Temperature_Normal IS {Temperature POSSREP {t INTEGER}};
	   TYPE Temperature_NoReading IS {Temperature POSSREP {}};
	   TYPE Temperature_OutOfRange IS {Temperature POSSREP {}};
	   VAR Readings REAL RELATION {timestamp INTEGER, 
	                          temp Temperature} KEY {timestamp};
	   INSERT Readings REL {
	    TUP {timestamp 12938, temp Temperature_Normal(33)},
  	    TUP {timestamp 12940, temp Temperature_Normal(33)},
  	    TUP {timestamp 12943, temp Temperature_Normal(34)},
  	    TUP {timestamp 12948, temp Temperature_NoReading()},
  	    TUP {timestamp 12955, temp Temperature_OutOfRange()}
	   };
 ...caused Rel crashes due to a "hash error" on Temperature_NoReading(), etc.
This has been corrected.

* Fix: Rel: Some CONSTRAINT failures displayed an un-helpful
"Transaction is not active" error message instead of identifying the
failing constraint.  This has been corrected.
