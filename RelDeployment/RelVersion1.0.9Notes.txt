This version of Rel -- an implementation of Date & Darwen's "Tutorial D" 
database language -- is a maintenance release featuring various
enhancements and bug fixes:

- Fix: Unicode support is now explicitly provided in Rel, DBrowser,
  and the RelClient middleware.  This should reduce the likelihood of
  errors or incorrect character translations when inputting unicode
  characters.

- Fix: Rel: A problem emitting escaped characters (special characters
  prefixed with a backslash, e.g., '\t') has been corrected, so that
  (for example) repeatedly backed up and restored Rel databases will
  no longer exhibit a harmless but awkward repetition of backslashes
  in certain string values.  E.g., names like "O\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Neil"
  should no longer occur.

- Fix: Rel: Replaced reference to
  "ca.mb.armchair.rel3.values.ValueChar" with
  "ca.mb.armchair.rel3.values.ValueCharacter" in
  ForeignCompilerJava.java.  This fixes problems creating new
  Java-based types which define methods/operators that use CHAR
  parameters.

- Enhancement/Fix: RelTest: Test suite has been redesigned to support
  execution of tests in random order.

- Enhancement/Fix: Rel: Updated to version 5.0.34 of Berkeley Java DB.
  As a side-effect of implementing this, occasional database
  corruptions leading to crashes -- typically referring to duplicate
  btree keys and the like -- should no longer occur.

- Enhancement: Rel: Temporary internal buffering of relations now
  dynamically switches from in-memory to disk-based storage based on
  cardinality.  This will improve performance on low-cardinality
  queries whilst supporting very high cardinality queries.

- Enhancement: Rel: Implemented mechanism to ensure expected version
  of Berkeley Java DB is installed.  This eliminates possible errors
  due to running an incompatible version of the Berkeley Java DB.

- Enhancement: Scripts: TypeDate.d now implement THE_readable, which
  obtains a human-friendly date.

- Enhancement: Rel: Improved speed of compiling Java-based types and
  operators.

- Enhancement: DBrowser: Crashes will now automatically open a dialog
  box to allow the user to send an error report to the developers.
